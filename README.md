# Vue 3 Reactivity

This material was created by [Marc Backes](https://twitter.com/themarcba) in order to show how reactivity is solved in Vue 3.

It contains a basic implementation of the Vue 3 reactivity engine - from scratch.

_A from the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2021 will be linked here once it is released for the public._

-   [Stage 5](tree/stage/5): Enhance observer pattern (with depsMap/targetMap)
-   [Stage 6](tree/stage/6): Add watcher
-   [Stage 7](tree/stage/7): Refactor code take out user code from lib code
